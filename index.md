### To Bridge the Gap Between Artificial Intelligence and the Real World Healthcare Challenges

Our group's long-term vision is to bridge the gap between artificial intelligence (AI) and human health. We advance machine learning to address real-world health challenge. Our research focuses on developing human-centered machine learning models that recognize patterns among diseases and develop therapies.
