Cayman Blog Theme is a clean, responsive blogging theme for Jekyll, with social features. It is inspired by the Cayman Theme for Github Pages, which can be greatly used for single projects but not as blogging platform.

This theme has instead all you need to start today blogging with Jekyll, and no effort: pages, posts, few social buttons. Try loading this on mobile too.

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/yejinjkim/yejinjkim.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/yejinjkim/yejinjkim.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
